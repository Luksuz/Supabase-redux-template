      const prompt = `You are an expert story consultant and content analyst. I will provide you with transcripts from multiple YouTube videos. Your task is to analyze them from a storytelling perspective and extract narrative elements that could inspire creative writing.

Your analysis should focus on:
1. Story-worthy themes and human experiences
2. Character types, motivations, and personality insights
3. Conflicts, tensions, and dramatic elements
4. Emotional journeys and transformations
5. Narrative structures and storytelling techniques
6. Creative inspiration for writers and scriptwriters

Video Count: ${videos.length}

${videoContents}

Instructions:
- For each video, identify narrative elements, emotional tones, and story-worthy content
- Extract themes that could drive compelling stories or scripts
- Identify character insights, personality types, and human motivations discussed
- Look for conflicts, challenges, and tensions that could create dramatic tension
- Generate specific story concepts inspired by the content
- Create a final creative prompt that would inspire a writer to craft a compelling story
- Focus on universal human experiences and emotions that resonate across cultures
- Consider both dramatic and comedic potential in the content
- Think about different genres: drama, comedy, thriller, romance, sci-fi, etc.

Return only the structured data without any additional text or formatting.`
