Frame the CTA as if some things are too confidential to share on YouTube (so they are more likely to sign up). Mention that the viewer will receive a free ebook copy of "The Kybalion" (hermetic book) upon signing up for a limited time only (this is not a reward). The viewer must go to the link in the description and enter their email to receive the e-book. This CTA must be incorporated smoothly and in flow with the script around it and can only be 2 sentences max. It must be short, sharp and concise so that viewers won't click off or skip. The CTA must use persuasive sales writing and sound as if some things can't be shared on YouTube, but you must come up with your own that suits the current section. It must be positioned in a way so viewers cannot afford to lose this opportunity to not sign up. Make sure you seamlessly flow into this CTA from the previous paragraph and into the next.`;
