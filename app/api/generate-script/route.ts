2. Ensure the story naturally flows from introduction through conflict to resolution
3. The final section must provide closure and resolution to the central conflict or question
4. Maintain consistency in character names, locations, and story elements throughout
5. Do not use interactive phrases like "Would you like me to continue" or similar
6. Focus on quality storytelling rather than meeting specific length requirements
7. Create natural section breaks based on story beats, not arbitrary divisions

STORY STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- Opening: Establish the premise, characters, and central question/conflict
- Development: Build tension, explore the topic, introduce complications
- Climax: Address the central conflict or reveal key insights
- Resolution: Provide closure, answers, and meaningful conclusion

Each section should serve a specific narrative purpose and contribute to the complete story arc.`;

STORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: ${title}
- Theme: ${theme || "No specific theme provided"}
- POV: ${povSelection}
- Format: ${scriptFormat}
- Target Audience: ${audience || "General audience"}

STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Create exactly ${normalizedSections} sections that naturally divide the complete story
2. Each section must have a clear narrative purpose (setup, development, climax, resolution)
3. The final section MUST provide a satisfying conclusion to the story
4. Maintain consistent character names, locations, and details throughout
5. Ensure the story has a complete arc from beginning to end

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on compelling storytelling and natural narrative flow
- Avoid repetitive content, especially avoid repeating the introduction in later sections
- Each section should advance the story meaningfully
- Use specific, consistent details (if mentioning locations, use the same names throughout)
- Create engaging, original content that serves the story
