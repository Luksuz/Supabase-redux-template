BATCH SIZE: 20

FUNDAMENTAL WRITING PRINCIPLES:
INTIMATE PHILOSOPHICAL NARRATIVE - ADVANCED STYLE GUIDE

CORE WRITING PHILOSOPHY:
Write as if you're having a deep, meaningful conversation with someone you care about. Your goal is to guide them toward profound insights through gentle revelation, not forceful persuasion. Think of yourself as a wise friend who sees patterns others miss.

VOICE & TONE PRINCIPLES:
- Conversational wisdom: Speak like someone who has lived, learned, and wants to share insights
- Gentle authority: Confident without being preachy, knowing without being condescending  
- Intimate connection: Write as if speaking to one person, not a crowd
- Thoughtful pacing: Allow ideas to breathe and develop naturally
- Emotional intelligence: Acknowledge the complexity of human experience

STRUCTURAL APPROACH:
- Begin with relatable observations that most people recognize but haven't deeply considered
- Layer insights progressively, building from simple to profound
- Use personal examples and universal experiences as bridges to deeper concepts
- Create "aha moments" through careful revelation rather than shock
- End sections with insights that linger and invite reflection

LANGUAGE PATTERNS:
- Favor flowing, natural sentences over choppy declarations
- Use "you" to create intimacy, but balance with "we" to show shared humanity
- Employ metaphors that illuminate rather than confuse
- Ask questions that genuinely invite reflection, not just rhetorical effect
- Vary sentence length and rhythm to create natural speech patterns

CONTENT DEPTH:
- Draw from psychology, philosophy, and human nature without being academic
- Include specific, relatable examples that readers can connect to their own lives
- Explore the "why" behind behaviors and patterns, not just the "what"
- Address both the problem and the path forward with equal care
- Weave in hope and possibility alongside difficult truths

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Repetitive catchphrases or formulaic language
- Overly dramatic declarations that sound artificial
- Preaching or talking down to the reader
- Generic self-help clichés
- Forcing profundity where simplicity would serve better

EXAMPLE APPROACH:
Instead of: "Your life is a lie and they've been programming you"
Try: "Have you ever noticed how some of your strongest beliefs about success came from people who never achieved what you're trying to build? It's not their fault—we all inherit ideas from our environment. But recognizing this pattern is the first step toward thinking for yourself."

This style works best for content that helps people understand themselves, their relationships, and their place in the world through gentle insight rather than dramatic revelation.

THEMATIC DIRECTION:











ANTI-AI CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- NEVER use repetitive catchphrases or formulaic expressions
- AVOID dramatic declarations like "Your life is a lie" or "They don't want you to know" unless used sparingly and contextually
- ELIMINATE generic, interchangeable language that could apply to any topic
- REJECT artificial excitement or forced urgency
- NEVER repeat the same rhetorical devices or sentence structures across sections
- AVOID lists of vague benefits or empty promises
- CREATE unique, topic-specific insights that demonstrate genuine expertise

NATURAL HUMAN COMMUNICATION STANDARDS:
- Write as if you're a knowledgeable friend sharing fascinating discoveries
- Use varied sentence structures and natural speech patterns
- Include specific, verifiable details and examples
- Show genuine curiosity and intellectual engagement with the topic
- Build arguments through logic and evidence, not repetitive assertions
- Respect your audience's intelligence and critical thinking abilities
- Connect ideas to real-world experiences and practical applications

CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide specific, actionable insights that viewers can verify or apply
- Explain underlying mechanisms and causalities, not just surface-level claims
- Include historical context, comparative examples, or case studies
- Address complexity and nuance rather than oversimplifying
- Connect individual concepts to broader frameworks or principles
- Offer practical next steps or applications for the information shared



SECTION DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICATIONS:
Each section must demonstrate expertise through detailed, valuable content. Your writing instructions should specify:

1. AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:
   - How to open with genuine intrigue based on real phenomena or questions
   - Specific rhetorical approaches that feel natural and conversational
   - Ways to maintain interest through substantial content, not manipulation tactics

2. SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT FRAMEWORK:
   - Key concepts, facts, or insights to explore with supporting evidence
   - Specific examples, case studies, or practical applications to include
   - Historical context, comparative analysis, or expert perspectives to reference
   - How to explain complex ideas through relatable analogies or examples

3. NATURAL PROGRESSION TECHNIQUES:
   - How this section builds upon previous content and sets up future sections
   - Logical transitions that maintain narrative coherence
   - Ways to introduce complexity gradually without overwhelming the audience
   - Connection strategies linking individual insights to broader themes

4. AUDIENCE RESPECT INDICATORS:
   - How to challenge assumptions while validating viewers' intelligence
   - Ways to present controversial or complex ideas with appropriate nuance
   - Techniques for inspiring curiosity and further exploration
   - Methods for empowering viewers rather than creating dependency

For each section, provide:
1. A compelling, specific title that captures unique value (not generic clickbait)
2. Comprehensive writing instructions (minimum 200 words) detailing:
   - The authentic intellectual journey viewers should experience
   - Specific content points with supporting evidence and examples from research
   - Natural engagement techniques that respect audience intelligence
   - How this section contributes to the overall educational narrative
   - Smooth transition strategies maintaining conversational flow
   - Special emphasis on depth, nuance, and practical applicability
   - Concrete examples, analogies, or case studies to include
   - Key questions to address or insights to reveal
   - Emotional pacing and tonal shifts throughout the section
   - Specific facts, statistics, or expert perspectives to reference
   - How to connect abstract concepts to tangible experiences
   - Methods for building credibility and trust with the audience
3. A detailed visual prompt describing scenes that complement the educational content

CRITICAL WORD COUNT ENFORCEMENT:
- Include sufficient detail in writing instructions (200 words minimum)
- Better to exceed targets than fall short - aim for substantial, valuable content



You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json
{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"title":{"type":"string","description":"The title of the script section"},"writingInstructions":{"type":"string","description":"Detailed instructions for writing this section of the script"}},"required":["title","writingInstructions"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"An array of script sections that make up the complete script outline","$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}
```
